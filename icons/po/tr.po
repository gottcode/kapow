"Kapow is a punch clock program designed to easily keep track of your hours, "
"whether you're working on one project or many. Simply clock in and out with "
"the Start/Stop button. If you make a mistake in your hours, you can go back "
"and edit any of the entries by double-clicking on the session in question. "
"Kapow also allows you to easily keep track of the hours since you last "
"billed a client, by providing a helpful \"Billed\" check box--the totals "
"will reflect your work after the last billed session."
