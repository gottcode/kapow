.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Kapow is a punch clock program designed to easily keep track of your hours,
whether you're working on one project or many. Simply clock in and out with
the Start/Stop button. If you make a mistake in your hours, you can go back
and edit any of the entries by double-clicking on the session in question.
Kapow also allows you to easily keep track of the hours since you last
billed a client, by providing a helpful "Billed" checkbox\-\-the totals will
reflect your work after the last billed session.
